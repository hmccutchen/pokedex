# pokedex
This project was built at NYCDA, its a simple *Pokemon pokedex*,
this project makes calls to the pokemon api and grab info for the specific pokemon I chose.

## The future
theres a chance i may refactor this project to make calls to every pokemon to behave similar to a *real* pokedex just for fun.
